# Fall-2025-ACM-Project-Hub

Viet:
* Developed the main codebase for `hand-wrist-elbow-track.py` integrating MediaPipe tracking with coordinate display system
* Created `robot_arm_visualizer.py` as a testing utility for validating robot arm positions
* Optimized coordinate display panels with color-coded information (red/blue for jaws, cyan for distance) and improved layout to avoid blocking camera view
